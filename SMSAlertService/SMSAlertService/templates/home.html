        <h5><strong>What is the SMS Alert Service?</strong></h5>
        <br/>
        <p>The SMS Alert Service continuously scans <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GunAccessoriesForSale/">r/GunAccessoriesForSale</a>
            and alerts you (via SMS) the instant an item you want is
            posted for sale. <br/><br/>You tell the service which items you want by adding keywords in your
            <a href="/profile">profile</a> page.<br/><br/>If you're hunting a specific item, the SMS
            Alert Service is the weapon of choice.</p><br/>

        <br/>
        <br/>
        <p>Once you've <a href="/signup">signed
            up</a> and gotten an Alert Package, simply add keywords on your
            <a href="/profile">profile</a> page to begin receiving alerts.
            <br/><br/><i>Alert Packages start at just $5 with alerts as low as $0.06!</i>

        <h5><strong>Why SMS Alert Service?</strong></h5>
        <br/>
        <p>The SMS Alert Service is purpose-built just for the GAFS community.
            We know there are free Reddit extensions on the market. However, we found that they were all too slow,
            too
            unreliable, and not ideal for a place like GAFS. This service is tailored to the specific needs of GAFS
            members, and is designed to save you money.
            <br/><br/>SMS Alert Service is built to be fast,
            reliable, and easy to use.
            You'll get notified within <strong>~5 seconds</strong> of the post hitting Reddit.<br/><br/>
