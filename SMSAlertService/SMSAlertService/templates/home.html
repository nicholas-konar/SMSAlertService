            <h5>What is the SMS Alert Service?</h5>
            <p>We constantly scan online marketplaces and alert our users (via SMS) when items on their wishlist become
                available. See the <strong>"Supported Markets"</strong> tab on this page to check which ones we cover.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <h5>How do I use it?</h5>
            <p>Once you've signed up, just add keywords to your profile and buy some alerts. That's it!
                When someone makes a new post in a Supported Market that contains one or more of those keywords, we'll
                text you a link to the post, so you don't miss out.</p>

            <h5>Tips</h5>
            <p>Computers take everything you say very literally, so be sure to structure your keywords
                in a way that's not too general, but not too narrow either. Here's some tips and tricks to get the most
                out of the service.</p>
            <div class="inner-container">
                <ul>
                    <li>There is no limit on how many keywords you can use.</li>
                    <li>Using broad terms like "magazine" in your keywords might waste alerts on things you don't need
                        or
                        want.</li>
                    <li>However, if you use "Glock magazine" as your <strong>only</strong> keyword, you won't get
                        notified
                        if the seller's post says something like
                        "Glock mag" or even "Glock magazine<strong>s</strong>."</li>
                    <li>The best strategy is to add <strong>multiple</strong> keywords for the same item. For example:
                        "Glock mag", "Glock mags", "Glock magazine", "Glock magazines", "G19 mag", "G19 mags", "G19
                        magazine", and so on.
                    </li>
                    <li>You'll receive a maximum of one sms alert per post, regardless of how many of your keywords are
                        present in that post.
                    </li>
